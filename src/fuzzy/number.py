    The fuzzy number may be continuous (the default) or discretized.  This is useful if the suitabilities may be
    easily defined by a mathematical function, but only valid for discrete values.
    There are three ways of doing this:

        * For an arbitrary collection of values, given in ``discrete``.
        * For a set of uniformly-spaced values, by setting ``uniform=True`` and, optionally, ``step`` and ``origin``.
        * Both of the above together.

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`.Literal._sample` to be the s(v) function that defines the fuzzy number.
    It's input and output are :class:`numpy.ndarray`\\ s, so it should be done using Numpy mathematics.

    Subclasses may well choose not to expose either or both discretization behaviors in their interface.
    They may also set their ``self.origin`` to a default, if it is not given on initialization.
    This should probably be the value where the function reaches its "peak" (``range[1]``), or some other
    critical point.  For example:

        | ``if origin is None:``
        |   ``origin = value_at_peak``

    Note:
        A Literal (or _Numerical) that represents a continuous function, can have exceptional points added by

            | ``a_function.xp = an_exception.xp``
