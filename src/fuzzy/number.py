"""applies the idea of fuzzy truth to the representation of numbers.

This module contains the public methods for obtaining useful results from fuzzy expressions---``crisp``, ``map``,
``t``, ``display``, and their variants.  This is the main interest for users, but privately, it contains
the basic apparatus for representing fuzzy numbers.  Just as :class:`Truth` objects are analogous
to ``bool``, :class:`.FuzzyNumber` objects are analogous to ``float``.  I'll introduce their representation,
give an example of their use, discuss the public methods mentioned above, and finally, for the curious,
sketch what goes on behind the scenes to make the module work.  Since fuzzy expressions are equivalent to their
resulting fuzzy number, I will speak of them interchangably.



Introduction
------------


A fuzzy number is a function of truth vs. value, :math:`t(v)`.  We may think of it as describing the
*suitability* of each possible value for some purpose.  In this way, we might state our opinions on a subject
as "preference curves".  Fuzzy numbers might also represent empirical knowledge about how one variable varies with
another in some fixed range.  And so, they can model the real world.  By combining these fuzzy numbers with arithmetic
and mathematical operators into expressions, we can represent more complex ideas and model the interaction of the
real world with our opinions.  Finally, we have one or more fuzzy numbers from which we obtain results in the form of
crisp numbers, control functions, or visualizations---results that we can act upon.
Ideally, the end of the process will make some aspect of the real world conform to our preferences.

Fuzzy solutions to complex problems can look much like the crisp solutions.  Consider a situation modeled by crisp
equations.  When the operators of those equations are made fuzzy, and the independent variables can be fuzzy, every
contingency can be planned for, and every subtle effect can be taken into account.

Suppose we state our opinions on preferred room temperature as fuzzy numbers.  Yours may differ from mine, but we
can combine them by ANDing them together and crsiping the result to find a compromise.  Enrich the model with
equations for energy prices, budget concerns, expected temperatures, time spent in the building, etc., and we can
automate our argument about the thermostat.

So, make all the natural-language statements you can about a system, its problems and heuristics.  They are already
very close to fuzzy statements, and are easily converted.  Your knowledge of a domain can easily become a very
sophisticated computer program automating your own judgment.




How to Use It
-------------

There are two worlds in play.  There is the familiar world of absolute truths and precise numbers that we will
call "crisp".  There is also the world of partial truths and indefinite numbers that we will call "fuzzy".
In the fuzzy world, the vagueness is measured with precision, so we can compute with it.  The intricacies happen
largely out of sight, so our calculations and reasoning retain their familiar form.  The main differences are:

    * We enter the fuzzy world by defining fuzzy numbers, either:

        * Literally---via intuitive parameters (as in the room temperature example, where a few simple parameters
          suffice to define a vague range of values); or,
        * Analytically---by adopting *as* fuzzy numbers informative functions that vary between established limits
          (as in the dissonance example, where a highly structured function depends upon complex parameters, like
          sound spectra).

    * Within the fuzzy world, we can use not only the familiar arithmetic operators in the usual way, but we can also
      combine numbers with the logical operators (*and*, *or*, *not*, and so on) to compute statements of reasoning.
    * The notion of weighting terms in an equation still exists, but in two forms: trinary
      (by :meth:`.Operator.weight`, ``//``) and binary (by :meth:`.Operator.focus`, ``^``).
    * We reÃ«nter the crisp world by the methods:

        * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp`, to render a :class:`.FuzzyNumber` as a single ``float``, indicating the
          most suitable value, ; or
        * :meth:`.map`, to make the suitability vs. value function of the fuzzy number a callable object,
          usable in crisp expressions, ideal for use as a control function; or
        * :meth:`.display`, to visualize the result.


A user will normally begin by creating some literal truth and number objects using :class:`.Truth` and, for the
numbers, subclasses of :class:`.Literal`.  These are then used as operands in expressions, and the expressions stored in
variables.  The operators are methods of class :class:`.Operator` and can be called either as normal Python
methods like ``c = Operator.mul(a,b)`` or ``c = a.mul(b)`` or simply with overloaded symbols, like ``c = a * b``.
Finally, a result is obtained from the expression by the public methods of :class:`.FuzzyNumber`.  So,
one might write something like this:

    | ``fuel_price = Truth(.8)`` # It's a bit high.
    | ``urgency = Truth(.3)``   # Arrival time isn't too critical.
    | ``fuel_efficiency = Bell(50, 20)``    # We get the best milage at 50 m.p.h.
    | ``promptness = Triangle(30, 70, 120)``    # ETA would be {too late, perfect, too soon}.
    | ``fuzzy_speed = (fuel_efficiency ^ fuel_price) & (promptness // urgency)``
    | ``crisp_speed = fuzzy_speed.crisp()``    # This is the ideal speed.
    | ``print(fuzzy_speed.t(crisp_speed))``    # Looks good.
    | ``accelerator(crisp_speed)``    # Step on it.

to decide the speed of a journey, weighing the desire to minimize cost with the need to arrive at an appointed time.
This is a toy example---expressions can be arbitrarily complex and these techniques may be embedded in conventional
algorithms---but you can see how sophisticated behavior can result from this technique.

Literals and operators will be detailed in the next two modules.  Three parts of the present module are public:

    * The class :class:`.Domain`,
    * The module attributes,
    * Public methods of :class:`.FuzzyNumber`.

A :class:`.Domain` object represents a single contiguous interval on the domain of real numbers.
Domains are used internally for the business of numerical representation; I don't expect most users will need them.
The module attributes act as rare parameters in the "environment" of the :mod:`.fuzzy` package.  All of them are
explained in :meth:`fuzzy.operator.fuzzy_ctrl`.   By far the most important part of the module to most users will be
the public methods of :class:`.FuzzyNumber`.  They obtain usable results from fuzzy expressions.

There are six of them:

    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.t` --- returns the truth of a given value.
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map` --- returns a callable object that functions as ``t`` above,
      with an optional mapping (linear, logarithmic, or exponential) of *truth* to an external variable.
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.numerical_map` --- does the same as ``map`` above, but storing the
      :math:`t(v)` function numerically rather than as a tree of operators and literals.
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp` --- returns a "defuzzified" version of the fuzzy number as a ``float``, the value
      of the number you may regard as the truest.
    * ``float()`` --- returns the same as :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp` above, using the defaults (a default resolution
      and no domain restriction.
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.display` --- displays a plot of the fuzzy number---its :math:`t(v)`.

Probably, the most used will be :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp`, which produces a single number that can be acted upon.
The :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map` method turns the fuzzy number into a function that can control a process, preserving all
the nuances of the fuzzy expression.  The :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.t` method can be used to measure the desirability of a
result, or to choose between proposed alternatives.  The :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.display` method may be the most useful
of all, allowing the user to see all the implications of an expression of fuzzy reasoning, perhaps revealing insights
or alternatives not suggested by ``crisp``.  In any of these cases, one can use an ``allowed_domain`` parameter to
focus attention (and calculation) on the area of interest.  With some expressions having large domains, this might be
necessary.  In the case of ``crisp`` and ``numerical_map``, it is also possible and highly recommended to set the
``resolution``, as only the user will know what is appropriate.


How It Works
------------


A fuzzy number is a function of truth vs. value, :math:`t(v)`.  Representations of this in the :mod:`.fuzzy` package
conceive of the function in three parts:

    * A default truth level that is reported for otherwise undefined values.  Sitting on top of this,
    * A segment of :math:`t(v)` defined over a single contiguous subdomain of the real numbers.  In :class:`.Literal`
      classes, this is defined analytically, by a Python method; in the :class:`._Numerical` class used internally for
      calculations, it is an array of :math:`(v, t)` sample points.  Overlaid on all of this is a sprinkling of
    * Discrete, "exceptional" points, represented as a set of :math:`(v, t)` pairs.

Only the first element, the default truth, is not optional.


:class:`.FuzzyNumber` is an abstract class from which the subclasses :class:`.Operator`
and :class:`._Numerical` descend; :class:`.Literal`, in turn, descends from :class:`.Operator`.
:class:`._Numerical` objects represent a fuzzy number numerically and are used for internal calculations.
:class:`.Operator`\\ s contain one or more operands which are
also :class:`.FuzzyNumber`\\ s---either :class:`.Operator`\\ s or :class:`.Literal`\\ s.  So, an expression
(which can be held in an ordinary Python variable) is a tree of :class:`.Operator`\\ s the "leaves" of which
are :class:`.Literal` objects.  Some of the :class:`.FuzzyNumber` methods (``t``, ``map``) do nothing but make
recursive calls down the tree to obtain their result.  Others (``crisp``, ``float``, ``numerical_map``,
and ``display``), produce a :class:`._Numerical` fuzzy number representing the result of the expression as an
intermediate step to their final result (a crisp value ``float``, a callable object representing :math:`t(v)`, or a
graphical display of :math:`t(v)`).

All descendants of :class:`.FuzzyNumber` must implement the public methods already mentioned:

    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.t`,
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map`,
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.numerical_map`,
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp` (``float()`` is overloaded to call this without parameters),
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.display`,

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.t` must return the truth of the number at a given value.   In :class:`.Literal`\\ s, the set of
exceptional pointsif first consulted.  If the given value is not among them, it looks for it on the domain of its
continuous function.  the :meth:`.Literal_sample` method returns the truth of the value, as it is
defined on the continuous domain.  In :class:`.Operator`\\ s, the operands are queried with their
:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.t` methods, and the results are operated upon with the operator's :meth:`.Operator._op`
method to obtain the result---this can result in arbitrarily complex recursive calls down the tree to the
:class:`.Literal`\\ s.  In :class:`._Numerical`\\ s, :math:`t(v)` on the defined domain is obtained by calling
an :class:`.Interpolator` with the number's sample points.  Failing all of this---if the given value is not an
explicitly defined point or on the defined continuous domain, the default, "elsewhere" truth is returned.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map` simply packages fuzzy expressions (trees of :class:`.Operator`\\ s and :class:`.Literal`\\ s)
into a callable object along with a handy mapping of the result.  So ``expression.t(v)`` can become ``function(v)``
in your code, where ``function`` is an object that can be passed around and sent to methods as needed.  Since it's
unlikely the output variable that you need is on [0,1], callable scales it to your desired range, by a linear,
logarithmic, or exponential mapping.   The scaling and mapping are defined at the time the callable is created.

There remaining methods require the creation of a numerical representation of the fuzzy expression.  This is the heart
of the module, and will be described below, with the private methods.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.numerical_map` does the same as :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map`, but instead of packaging a tree and
making recursive calls down to all the literals, it creates a numerical representation of the expression (a
:class:`._Numerical`) and packages that.  Although less accurate than :meth:`.FuzzyNumber.map`, it can be made as
accurate as it needs to be, and may be more efficient in some cases.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.crisp` creates a :class:`._Numerical` and delegates the business of crisping it to a
:class:`.Crisper` object, as there are many defuzzification algorithms to choose from.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber.display`, creates a :class:`._Numerical` and graphs it via :mod:`.matplotlib`.  The default
settings choose a resolution of one sample point per pixel, so that the function is presented fairly with no
computation wasted.   The continuous part is graphed as a red line, the discrete points as blue dots, and the
default truth as a yellow horizontal line.  As usual, a domain parameter allows one to focus on areas of interest.

All descendants of :class:`.FuzzyNumber` also have the following private methods, used internally to provide
the functionality of the above:

    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_domain`, which reports the interval of real numbers on which the continuous part of
      the :math:`t(v)` function is defined (explicitly defined discrete points may lie outside this).
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical`, which returns a numerical representation of the fuzzy number, a
      :class:`._Numerical` object, given an ``allowed_domain`` and a ``precision`` (an integer number of sample
      points used to represent function over its continuous domain).
    * :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._expression_as_numerical`, does the same as :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical`, but for
      a given ``resolution`` (smallest significant difference in value) instead of precision.

The first two are abstract, and must be implemented by descendants of :class:`.FuzzyNumber`.  The third is implemented
in  :class:`.FuzzyNumber` itself.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_domain` is easy for :class:`.Literal`\\ s and :class:`._Numerical`\\ s, since it is simply
part of the object's definition.   In :class:`.Operator` objects, the operator calls the method on its own operands,
obtaining one or more :class:`.Domain` objects, and then putting them through its own :meth:`.Operator.d_op` method
to predict the domain of all its possible results.

When :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical` is called on a :class:`.Literal` object, it samples its own continuous domain
(ignoring exceptional points) by calling its :meth:`.Literal_sample` method on a domain given it by the caller
(an important point, discussed below).
(N.B., the default sampling of literals is by Chebyshev collocation points, but uniformly-spaced samples are an
option; in any case, guard points outside the defined domain are taken to ensure good interpolation near the edges.)
When :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical` is called on :class:`.Operator`\\ s, they first call
:meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical` on their operands to obtain :class:`._Numerical` versions of them.  They then
do what they have to do with these to obtain a :class:`._Numerical` result.  This can be quite involved, and is
described in :mod:`fuzzy.operator`.

:meth:`.FuzzyNumber._expression_as_numerical` is the method actually called by the public methods that require a
numerical version of their fuzzy number.  The user calling one of those methods knows something the :mod:`fuzzy`
package cannot predict:  the resolution of the result required for the user's application.  The user, on the other
hand, cannot easily predict the precision (the number of sample points) that will be needed to achieve this.
:meth:`.FuzzyNumber._expression_as_numerical` translates the user's required ``resolution`` into the ``precision``
parameter for the internal :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical` call.
The required precision is the span of the "natural domain" that the expression defines divided by the given resolution.
This domain is found by querying the expression with :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_domain`, a call which propagates all the
way down to every literal, returning results back to the root of the tree through the transforms of each operator's
:meth:`.Operator.d_op` method.  This is the domain over which the expression is defined as a continuous function, if
there are no other constraints.

There may well be other constraints.   The user may only be interested in solutions over a subdomain of the natural
domain, some values for which the function is defined mathematically may be physically nonsensical, and some natural
domains may be impractically large, e.g., if division by small numbers is involved.  The user therefore, may restrict
the ``allowed_domain`` of the result by a parameter.  It's the intersection of this and the natural domain that is
used to determine the precision.  It also determines the  domain given in every downward call
of :meth:`.FuzzyNumber._get_numerical`.  When operators make this call on their operands, they must transform the
domain of the result to that of the operands---the inverse of the domain transformation of :meth:`.Operator.d_op`.
In this way, all the sample points are applied only to regions of literals that will make a difference in the
domain of interest to the user---no precision is wasted.

        of its operands, operate on them, and return the numerical result.  This method is called by
        :meth:`._expression_as_numerical`, which calculates the precision and begins the cascade of recursive calls.

        Arguments:
            precision: The number of sample points used to cover the domain of the continuous function part of
                the result.  This determines how accurately the result represents the original.  It will have been
                calculated in :meth:`._expression_as_numerical` from the caller's desired ``resolution``, the minimum
                significant difference in value.  (In practice, two guard points will always be added outside the
                domain to ensure good interpolation near its edges.)
            allowed_domain: The extreme domain on which a result is acceptable.  Ultimately, recursive calls of this

            :class:`.Operator`\\ s hold their operands, which are fuzzy numbers---either :class:`.Literal`\\ s or more
            Operators---so calling this method on an expression built up in this way can result in many recursive
            calls.  By restricting the requested domain with ``allowed_domain`` at each step, calculations avoid
            considering inconsequential values, and concentrate all of their precision (sample points) only
            on stretches of domain that will have a bearing on the final result.
